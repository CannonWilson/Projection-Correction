# Surface Difference Test Results

This folder contains the results of a test where we placed an irregular
surface (a slanted computer monitor) in front of the target surface (a wall).
The system was allowed to make up to 9 corrections to the projected 
image, with rec_0 being the uncorrected image.

When comparing the transformed recorded images before and after this 
iterative projection process, one can see that the system corrected for the 
irregular surface in the bottom-left-hand corner but that the system also
introduced slight color artifacts.
