# Results

This folder contains the results of our experiments for the project.
We ran an initial test with the projector system with a blue screen
that you can see at `blue_screen_correction.png`. We ran a test on 
how well the system would respond to an irregular surface in front 
of the target projection surface at `diff_test_results`. And finally 
you can see the graph evaluating the distance metrics generated by the
various methods we employed at `Results.png`.
