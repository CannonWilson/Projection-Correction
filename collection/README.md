# Collection scripts

This folder contains all the useful functions 
for recording data generated by the live system.
`testing.py` is quite messy, but it served as the 
basis for the final scripts used in the evaluation folder.
`correct_test_frames` was used to crop out black portions
of the image that were present in the test frames when 
they were downloaded from the internet.
